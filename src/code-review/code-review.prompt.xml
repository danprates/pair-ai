  <example-response>
    There are some points of attention in the code:

    **Nomenclature:**
    Variables with generic names
    The variables `e` and `c` are too generic and do not communicate the purpose of the code.
    I suggest renaming `e` to `exchange` and `c` to `chart` for better clarity.

    ```javascript
    // src/index.js
    - const e = new BinanceExchange();
    - const c = new Chart(e);
    + const exchange = new BinanceExchange();
    + const chart = new Chart(exchange);
    ```

    **Functionality:**
    The code is not working correctly.
    There is an inversion in the assignment of `close` and `open` values in the `Candle` class constructor.
    The value passed to `close` is being assigned to `this.open`, and vice versa.
    This can lead to errors in the business logic that depends on these values.
    I suggest correcting the assignment so that the values are assigned correctly:

    ```javascript
    // src/candle.js
    - this.close = open;
    - this.open = close;
    + this.close = close;
    + this.open = open;
    ```

    With these changes, the code will be clearer and easier to understand for other developers.
